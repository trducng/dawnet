      "Okay, let's see. The user is asking how close in meaning the two sentences are, from 0 to 5. First, I need to compare the two sentences.\n",

      "Starting with the first sentence: \"r/offmychest\". That seems like a typo or maybe a misspelling. Maybe \"r/offmychest\" was intended to be \"r/ my chest\" but with some other text. But regardless, the user provided that as part of the input, so I should focus on the meaning here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the second sentence: \"I'm worried about moving out of parent's house and into an apartment with a boyfriend who doesn't really seemed worried at all.\" The key points here are the worry about moving out, the parent's house, and the boyfriend not seeming worried.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comparing with the first sentence: The first sentence mentions \"my chest\" which might refer to something related to moving, like the chest of a person. The second sentence talks about the house and the boyfriend's actions. The original first sentence's mention of \"my chest\" might be a red herring or a typo. But the main content is about being tired and scared of moving out. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the first sentence's main points are \"tired and scared of moving out—my boyfriend's not worried.\" The second sentence adds details about the parent's house and the boyfriend's lack of concern. Therefore, the first sentence is more about the general feeling of being scared, while the second adds more specific details about the situation involving the boyfriend and the parent. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of meaning similarity, the first sentence has more general statements, while the second adds more specific information. Therefore, the similarity is less than 5. The answer should be 2.5 or something like that, but since it's a number from 0 to 5, maybe 2.5? But maybe the user wants a clean number. Alternatively, maybe the first sentence is more similar. Let me check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the first sentence says \"my boyfriend's not worried.\" The second sentence says \"the boyfriend who doesn't really seemed worried at all.\" The first sentence says \"my boyfriend,\" while the second mentions the boyfriend. So maybe the first sentence is more concise, focusing on the boyfriend's lack of worry, while the second adds more details. So, the first sentence's main idea is about the boyfriend's lack of concern, while the second adds more specifics. Therefore, the similarity is lower. But since the first sentence has \"my chest\" which might be a typo, but if we assume the user meant that, then the meaning is closer. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is 2.5? Or maybe the first sentence is better. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo in the first sentence, so it's more about the boyfriend's worry, but since the original was \"my chest,\" maybe that's a red herring. I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is 2.5 or 3. But since the user wants a number from 0 to 5, perhaps 2.5. Alternatively, maybe the first sentence is more similar. But I need to be precise here. Let me think again. The key is whether the first sentence captures the same meaning as the second. The first has \"my chest\" which might not be relevant. The second has \"the boyfriend\" and the details about the house. So the first sentence is more about being scared of moving out, while the second adds more specific information. Therefore, the answer is lower than 5. Maybe 2.5. But since it's a numerical answer, maybe 2.5. But perhaps the correct number is 2.5. Or maybe 2. I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the first sentence is \"I'm tired and scared of moving out—my boyfriend's not worried\" and the second is \"I'm worried about moving out of parent's house and into an apartment with a boyfriend who doesn't really seemed worried at all,\" then the first sentence is more concise and the second adds more specific details. So the similarity is 2.5. Therefore, the answer is 2.5.\n",

It was a horrible time in my life due to living with my mother and finally having the chance to cut her out of my life. I can admit because of it was an emotional wreck and this guy was stable and didn't know how to deal with me. We ended by him avoiding for a month or so after going to a festival with my friends. When I think back I wish he just ended. So after he ended it added my depression I suffered but my friends helped me through it and I got rid of everything from him along with cutting contact. \n",

      "Now: Its been almost 3 years now and I've gotten better after counselling and mild anti depressants. My mother has been out of my life since then so there's been alot of progress. Being stronger after learning some lessons there been more insight about that time of my life but when I see him or a picture everything comes back. The emotions and memories bring me back down. \n",

Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it's because I haven't been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven't been exercising as frequently as I've gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I've felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14!

      "POST: So I have been in what I consider a serious relationship for a few years now. Like any relationship we've had our ups and downs, but things have been great these past few months. I recently started a new job, and don't get to see my bf as often as I would like to anymore. And on top of that I've found myself attracted to my supervisor, and to be honest; it scares me. I know that nothing will happen, and I'm pretty much 100% certain that it is one sided, but the fact that I feel this way bothers me and makes me feel incredibly guilty. I know if I found out that my boyfriend had these feelings for another woman I would be crushed. I've had crushes before, but this seems very different, in reality, he and I barely talk so the feeling is mostly physical. And as much as I try I find myself thinking about him a lot; more than I feel I should. I find that I have this urge to talk to him more and get to know him, but I haven't. On one hand I think that maybe once I know him a little more the feeling will go away (you know, realize they have gross habits or something like that) but on the other hand if it doesn't I've made things a lot worse. But even so, I find myself imagining scenarios and situations where we're together. \n",

But when I'm upset with my boyfriend or feel like he's ignoring me I find myself thinking about this other man. And I feel awful for doing so.

Maybe 4 because the user is in SF, so the 1st summary is a bit too generic.

My apartment doesn't have AC (I'm in NYC) and I usually like to leave the windows open for ventilation. They've got child bars, but because Luna is so small she can easily fit through them--and did a few moments ago. Nearly gave me a heart attack watching her slip through them and walked out onto a very narrow ledge 5 floors above a concrete sidewalk. She came right back in, but now I'm concerned about having a dead cat on my hands (or more accurately, on my sidewalk). So my question is, should I trust her cat instincts and leave the windows open?

A few minutes later, with the speed of 6 hyenas, he jumped forward and bit me on the arm. For about a second or two I sat there, completely bewildered as he nibbled on my arm.

The ones who accept everyone to this degree and see that we all can use values from some source or religion/non-religion are the outstanding people. However, the longer I lurk and browse Reddit, the more I see that the atheism subreddit demands the most attention. They follow one another's' beliefs as if they were following a religion, and though they do not have a leader or supreme being, they do enjoy posting links that breed the same hate and intolerance as other religions do. I would like to think that some people are different and that perhaps a subreddit that would speak of indifference towards others would exist somewhere; and some people would motion for that change of universal tolerance of everyone and everything; however I now see that /r/atheism is just another religion. I'm sorry to those who cannot speak their mind in any religious or nonreligious threads for fear of losing karma or getting down voted and that as much as the followers of /r/atheism try to say they are not a hivemind and that they speak out as individuals, collectively they are a group.

Since these pups will soon be fit to be taken away from their mother, I was going to use Shy as a way to figure out a rough estimate as to how many bronies live in my area, outside of high school and college, by how many prospective adopters catch on to the name. The fact that the pup is named after a pony from a TV show escaped from everyone, until today, when, in a discussion about Amnesia, I mention Alois from the Justine DLC of Amnesia. Both of my brothers ask who he is and I explain to them the previous information and am met with blank looks. I explain to them again as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yeah, you remember, they took Fluttershy (the pony, not the pup) and made her into him in 'A Small Horse?'\" (A custom story for Amnesia for those who don't know)\n",
      "\n",
      "And that's when they connected the dots and questioned after my reasons for naming a beautiful and shy little pitbull pup after an animated pony from a TV show.\n",

The post talks about a social experiment involving a pug named Fluttershy, a family issue with their pets, and a connection to video game lore (Alois from Amnesia).

The thing is when we aren't together, he is with his mother, his mother who hates me, even though she has never met me. To her I'm a hood rat (but actually from a good [wealthy] family), Problem is I have tattooes, or atleast that is all he let me understand is wrong.So i guess i have to call a spade a spade, we are done.  But the biggest problem for me is that he is my best friend. While I don't want to leave my house or stop crying, the only person I want to see is him, he is my best friend. How do I go from talking to him about everything everyday, to not having him at all? I know no answer will give me solace. I know his feelings are there, he is just scared and even more importantly, scared of 'hurting' his family. I know I rambled but I just lost what was potentially the love of my life to cowardness. I guess all I'm asking is for advice, I know I can get over this, I'm just scared because I don't want too. We have gone down this road so many times, the problem is this time its for real.

By around 10 pm I was piss drunk, I was hooking up with this cute girl, seems like a great night so far. Then my drunk brain thought it would be funny to piss on my friend. So I unzipped by shorts and whipped out my donger and started pissing on my friend a little. He got a bit pissed and started punching me in return. I was trying to block his punches cos he was drunk and was punching pretty hard. After he stopped, I was complaining about the punches and shit then I went back to raving and grinding with the girl I was hooking up with. The thing is that I forgot to put my donger back in my shorts so he was raving with me. All my mates were laughing, the girl I was with turned around and laughed too but I was too drunk to care and continued for a while until 10-15 minutes later this stranger came up with me and pointed at my donger. I shoved it back in whilst everyone was still laughing. Again I was too drunk to give a fuck so I just raved on. The girl was cool with it and stayed with me still.

Before there are any suspicions, my mom wasn't scolding him in a demeaning or abusing way; she is just tired of telling him over and over again to pick up after himself. Next thing I hear, he is calling for me from our family room and tells me our sun conure is \"sick\". When I get to the birdcage I see that our bird is lying on the top of the cage, bleeding from his nose, and clearly struggling to breathe. I ask my brother what happened and he tells me the bird \"fell from his cage\". I call desperately for my mom and she tells me he is dying. The next two minutes are complete agony as I watch my bird, *who has been one of my best friends for the last 11 years*, die by suffocating on his blood. At this point I'm in tears, and I ask my brother exactly what happened since there is no way falling from his cage would have caused such severe injuries.

He has talked to the school counselor and has had regular sessions with a therapist, but I feel they are useless. His counselors have always given him the benefit of the doubt and held us responsible for his behavior. This troubles me as it removes any responsibility or sense of remorse for his actions. Case in point, when my mom talked to him about what he did he said that \"it wasn't his fault he inherited his dad's temper\". My bird did not deserve to die this way, and I fear that his anger problem could get worse. I will continue to follow his counselors advice and try to understand him, but it's difficult when he rejects advice and gets visibly frustrated when my mom or dad talk to him.\n",

      "POST: I dated this guy for 7 months who never called me his gf but would say he loved me and wanted to be exclusive. Caught him \"cheating\" and I dumped him. He begged and cried but I did not give in as much as I wanted to. Now a year later I am in a great relationship and love him to bits but by my own foolishness I reinstated my facebook and looked my ex up. He isn't \"in a relationship\" but the girl he cheated with was all over it.

      "POST: So I'm currently pregnant so its possible I'm reading too much into this but he seems to enjoy making me angry? For example, today we were talking and his best friend has recently started dating a girl that he has a history with. Even though she is dating his friend and we're about to have a baby she is still over him and has tried to hook up with him in the past months. He's told her no but it hasn't stopped her from trying. Recently she's backed off a little and is trying to be more of a friend to him and he says that I need to just \"get over it and get along with her.\" I don't start fights with her or yell at her I just refuse to be her friend or be around her as I have no desire to keep her company. He mentioned that she invited him to come to some child expo with her (while I'm at work) and he said he didn't want to go without me (for fear that she would try something). And I said that was probably for the best because it would've upset me if he went. Then he responded and said that made him want to go with her just to piss me off because I have no right to get upset. I don't understand why he would want to do something like that to intentionally hurt me. It wasn't like I lost it and \"forbid\" him from going,  I just said it would upset me. Am I overreacting and shouldn't have said that or is he just being an asshole because with my hormones I cant tell anymore.\n",

      "POST: Last month, I started getting really hormonal and feeling downright crazy (becoming paranoid about my awesome boyfriend for absolutely no reason, crying at the drop of a hat, and all of that jazz.). Right around that time, my gyno told me that I was due to have my IUD removed. Oh, okay! That's why I was a hormonal wreck! Bada bing, bada boom, I'll get it replaced and everything will be back to normal.\n",

      "When I got to his office for what was meant to be a routine appointment, he found a large mass in one of my ovaries--and told me that I needed to have a hysteroscopy to get my IUD removed. He scheduled the hysteroscopy and the aspiration of the mass for the next day. I was horrified and scared shitless. My boyfriend was very supportive, stayed up late rubbing my neck the night before the procedure, came with me to the doctor, took me out for more meals than I can count so that I didn't have to cook, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's been a week since the procedures and, frankly, I don't really feel any less scared, anxious, or paranoid. Now I feel like there's something I'm always going to have to worry about. From what I understand based on talking to other women, this is a feeling that will eventually go away. But how do I explain myself to my partner and let him know that I'm aware that I'm being crazy right now without sounding like I'm trying to make excuses for being a completely and totally irrational asshole?\n",
